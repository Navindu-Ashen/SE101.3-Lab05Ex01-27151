Create a class named "BankAccount" with private instance variables "accountNumber" and "balance." Implement encapsulation by providing public getter and setter methods for both variables. Additionally, create an abstract method called "calculateInterest" in the "BankAccount" class. Implement two subclasses, "SavingsAccount" and "Checking Account," that extend the "BankAccount" class and provide their own implementations of the "calculateInterest" method. Write the implementation code for the getter and setter methods in the "BankAccount" class, and the "calculateInterest" method in both the "Savings Account" and "CheckingAccount" classes. Assuming that the interest for saving is 12% and checking is 2% (both private variables), find out What will be the interest for a person with 1 million in his checking and 20 million in his saving account.
